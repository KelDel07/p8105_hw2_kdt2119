# Problem 1

## Importing, reading and cleaning Mr.Trash Wheel sheet.

The code below will read the sheet of interest in the dataset, omit
non-data entries and rows that do not include dumpster-specific data,
and round the number of sports balls to the nearest integer.

``` r
trashwheel_df = 
  read_excel("Trash-Wheel-Collection-Totals-7-2020-2.xlsx", sheet = 1, range = "A2:N534") %>% 
  janitor::clean_names() %>% 
  drop_na(dumpster) %>% 
  mutate(sports_balls = round(sports_balls, 0))
```

## Reading and cleaning the 2018 and 2019 precipitation data.

``` r
precip2019_df = 
  read_excel("Trash-Wheel-Collection-Totals-7-2020-2.xlsx", sheet = 6, range = "A2:B14") %>% 
  janitor::clean_names() %>% 
  mutate(year = 2019)

precip2018_df = 
  read_excel("Trash-Wheel-Collection-Totals-7-2020-2.xlsx", sheet = 7, range = "A2:B14") %>% 
  janitor::clean_names() %>% 
  mutate(year = 2018)

precip_2018_2019_df =
  bind_rows(precip2019_df, precip2018_df) %>%
  mutate(month = month.name[month])
```

## Description of Data

The total number of observations in the Mr. Trash Wheel sheet is 453
observations. It also has 14 variables. Examples of the variables in the
dataset are dumpster, year, weight\_tons. In the data, there are
dumpsters numbered from 1 to 453. The median number of sports balls in a
dumpster in 2019 is 9 balls.

The total number of observations in the precipitation data set is 24
observations. It also has 3 variables. Examples of the variables in the
dataset are dumpster, month, year. 2018 had a total precipitation of
70.33 inches and 2019 had 33.95 inches.

# Question 2

## Reading and cleaning the pols-month.csv file

``` r
polsmonth_df = 
  read_csv("pols-month.csv") %>% 
  janitor::clean_names() %>%
  
  separate(mon,into = c("year","month","day"),sep = "-") %>%
  pivot_longer(c(prez_gop,prez_dem), names_prefix = "prez_", names_to = "president") %>% 
  filter(value > 0) %>%
  
  select(-day, -value) %>% 
  
  mutate(year = as.integer(year), month = as.integer(month), month = month.name[month]) %>% 
  arrange(year, month)
```

## Reading and cleaning the snp.csv file

``` r
snp_df = 
  read_csv("snp.csv") %>% 
  janitor::clean_names() %>%
  
  separate(date,into = c("month","day","year"),sep = "/") %>%
  mutate(year = as.integer(year), year = ifelse(year > 21, 1900 + year, 2000 + year), month = as.integer(month), month = month.name[month]) %>% 
  
  select(-day) %>% 
  select(year, month, close) %>% 
  
  arrange(year, month)
```

## Reading and cleaning the unemployment.csv file

``` r
unemploy_df = 
  read_csv("unemployment.csv") %>% 
  janitor::clean_names() %>%
  pivot_longer(c(jan:dec),
    names_to = "month", 
    values_to = "unemployment") %>%
  mutate(year = as.integer(year),
    month = recode(month, "jan" = "January", "feb" = "February", "mar" = "March", "apr" = "April", "may" = "May", "jun" = "June", "jul" = "July", "aug" = "August", "sept" = "September", "oct" = "October", "nov" = "November", "dec" = "December")) %>% 
  arrange(year, month)
```

## Merging and describing data

``` r
ans_merge_df =  left_join(polsmonth_df, snp_df, by = c("year", "month"))

ans_final_df = left_join(ans_merge_df, unemploy_df, by = c("year", "month"))
```

The polsmonth\_df dataset contains 822 observations of 9 variables, that
describe the national number of democratic and republican politicians at
various points in time.

The snp\_df dataset contains 787 observations of 3 variables regarding
Standard & Poor’s stock market index (S&P),

The merged dataset, ans\_final\_df, contains 822 observations of 11
variables. with a range of years from 1947 to 2015. Some key variables
include year, president, close, unemployment.

# Question 3

## Read and clean the NYC open data on Popular\_Baby\_names.csv

The data need to be cleaned in the ethnicity column because there are
coded records like **“BLACK NON HISP” and “ASIAN AND PACIFIC
ISLANDER.”** It is also noted that in certain rows, **HISPANIC** is
coded as **HISP**. A consistent coding pattern needs to be created
within the dataset

``` r
child_names_df = 
  read_csv("Popular_Baby_Names.csv") %>% 
  janitor::clean_names() %>% 
  mutate(childs_first_name = str_to_title(childs_first_name),    
         ethnicity = recode(ethnicity,
    "ASIAN AND PACI" = "ASIAN AND PACIFIC ISLANDER",
    "BLACK NON HISP" = "BLACK NON HISPANIC", 
    "WHITE NON HISP" = "WHITE NON HISPANIC")) %>%
  distinct()
```

## Baby Name Popularity Ocer Time

The code below will produce a well-structured, reader-friendly table
showing the rank in popularity of the name “Olivia” as a female baby
name over time.

``` r
popoliv_df = 
  filter(child_names_df, childs_first_name == "Olivia" & gender == "FEMALE") %>% 
  select(year_of_birth, ethnicity, rank) %>%
    pivot_wider(names_from = "year_of_birth", values_from = "rank")
knitr::kable(popoliv_df)
```

| ethnicity                  | 2016 | 2015 | 2014 | 2013 | 2012 | 2011 |
|:---------------------------|-----:|-----:|-----:|-----:|-----:|-----:|
| ASIAN AND PACIFIC ISLANDER |    1 |    1 |    1 |    3 |    3 |    4 |
| BLACK NON HISPANIC         |    8 |    4 |    8 |    6 |    8 |   10 |
| HISPANIC                   |   13 |   16 |   16 |   22 |   22 |   18 |
| WHITE NON HISPANIC         |    1 |    1 |    1 |    1 |    4 |    2 |

The code below will produce a well-structured, reader-friendly table
showing the rank in popularity of the most popular name as a male baby
name over time.

``` r
male_df = 
  filter(child_names_df, gender == "MALE" & rank == 1) %>% 
  select(year_of_birth, ethnicity, childs_first_name) %>%
    pivot_wider(names_from = "year_of_birth",
      values_from = "childs_first_name")
knitr::kable(male_df)
```

| ethnicity                  | 2016   | 2015   | 2014   | 2013   | 2012   | 2011    |
|:---------------------------|:-------|:-------|:-------|:-------|:-------|:--------|
| ASIAN AND PACIFIC ISLANDER | Ethan  | Jayden | Jayden | Jayden | Ryan   | Ethan   |
| BLACK NON HISPANIC         | Noah   | Noah   | Ethan  | Ethan  | Jayden | Jayden  |
| HISPANIC                   | Liam   | Liam   | Liam   | Jayden | Jayden | Jayden  |
| WHITE NON HISPANIC         | Joseph | David  | Joseph | David  | Joseph | Michael |

## Scatter plot

The code below will produce a scatter plot showing the number of
children with a name (y axis) against the rank in popularity of that
name (x axis), for male, white, non hispanic children born in 2016.

``` r
scatter_df = 
  filter(child_names_df,
    gender == "MALE",
    ethnicity == "WHITE NON HISPANIC",
    year_of_birth == 2016)


ggplot(scatter_df, aes(x = rank, y = count)) + geom_point()
```
