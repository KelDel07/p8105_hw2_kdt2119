# Problem 1

## Importing, reading and cleaning Mr.Trash Wheel sheet.

The code below will read the sheet of interest in the dataset, omit
non-data entries and rows that do not include dumpster-specific data,
and round the number of sports balls to the nearest integer.

``` r
trashwheel_df = 
  read_excel("Trash-Wheel-Collection-Totals-7-2020-2.xlsx", sheet = 1, range = "A2:N534") %>% 
  janitor::clean_names() %>% 
  drop_na(dumpster) %>% 
  mutate(sports_balls = round(sports_balls, 0))
```

## Reading and cleaning the 2018 and 2019 precipitation data.

``` r
precip2019_df = 
  read_excel("Trash-Wheel-Collection-Totals-7-2020-2.xlsx", sheet = 6, range = "A2:B14") %>% 
  janitor::clean_names() %>% 
  mutate(year = 2019)

precip2018_df = 
  read_excel("Trash-Wheel-Collection-Totals-7-2020-2.xlsx", sheet = 7, range = "A2:B14") %>% 
  janitor::clean_names() %>% 
  mutate(year = 2018)

precip_2018_2019_df =
  bind_rows(precip2019_df, precip2018_df) %>%
  mutate(month = month.name[month])
```

## Description of Data

The total number of observations in the Mr.Â Trash Wheel sheet is 453
observations. It also has 14 variables. Examples of the variables in the
dataset are dumpster, year, weight\_tons. In the data, there are
dumpsters numbered from 1 to 453. The median number of sports balls in a
dumpster in 2019 is 9 balls.

The total number of observations in the precipitation data set is 24
observations. It also has 3 variables. Examples of the variables in the
dataset are dumpster, month, year. 2018 had a total precipitation of
70.33 inches and 2019 had 33.95 inches.
