# Problem 1

## Importing, reading and cleaning Mr.Trash Wheel sheet.

The code below will read the sheet of interest in the dataset, omit
non-data entries and rows that do not include dumpster-specific data,
and round the number of sports balls to the nearest integer.

``` r
trashwheel_df = 
  read_excel("Trash-Wheel-Collection-Totals-7-2020-2.xlsx", sheet = 1, range = "A2:N534") %>% 
  janitor::clean_names() %>% 
  drop_na(dumpster) %>% 
  mutate(sports_balls = round(sports_balls, 0))
```

## Reading and cleaning the 2018 and 2019 precipitation data.

``` r
precip2019_df = 
  read_excel("Trash-Wheel-Collection-Totals-7-2020-2.xlsx", sheet = 6, range = "A2:B14") %>% 
  janitor::clean_names() %>% 
  mutate(year = 2019)

precip2018_df = 
  read_excel("Trash-Wheel-Collection-Totals-7-2020-2.xlsx", sheet = 7, range = "A2:B14") %>% 
  janitor::clean_names() %>% 
  mutate(year = 2018)

precip_2018_2019_df =
  bind_rows(precip2019_df, precip2018_df) %>%
  mutate(month = month.name[month])
```
