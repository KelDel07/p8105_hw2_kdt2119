# Problem 1

## Importing, reading and cleaning Mr.Trash Wheel sheet

The code below will read the sheet of interest in the dataset, omit
non-data entries and rows that do not include dumpster-specific data,
and round the number of sports balls to the nearest integer.

``` r
trashwheel_df = 
  read_excel("Trash-Wheel-Collection-Totals-7-2020-2.xlsx", sheet = 1, range = "A2:N534") %>% 
  janitor::clean_names() %>% 
  drop_na(dumpster) %>% 
  mutate(sports_balls = round(sports_balls, 0))
```
